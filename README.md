## Overview
**VTS** (short for Vector Transport Service) is an open-source tool for moving [vectors](https://zilliz.com/glossary/vector-embeddings) and [unstructured data](https://zilliz.com/learn/introduction-to-unstructured-data). It is developed **by** [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/) based on **Apache Seatunnel**.

## Why do you need a vector and unstructured data moving tool?
1. **Meeting the Growing Data Migration Needs:** VTS evolves from our Milvus Migration Service, which has successfully helped over 100 organizations migrate data between [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) clusters. User demands have grown to include migrations from different [vector databases](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database), traditional search engines like [Elasticsearch](https://zilliz.com/comparison/milvus-vs-elastic) and Solr, [relational databases](https://zilliz.com/blog/relational-databases-vs-vector-databases), data warehouses, document databases, and even S3 and data lakes to Milvus.
2. **Supporting Real-time Data Streaming and Offline Import:** As vector database capabilities expand, users require both real-time data streaming and offline batch import options.
3. **Simplifying Unstructured Data Transformation:** Unlike traditional ETL, transforming unstructured data requires AI and model capabilities. VTS, in conjunction with the [Zilliz Cloud Pipelines](https://zilliz.com/zilliz-cloud-pipelines), enables vector embedding, tagging, and complex transformations, significantly reducing data cleaning costs and operational complexity.
4. **Ensuring End-to-End Data Quality:** Data integration and synchronization processes are prone to data loss and inconsistencies. VTS addresses these critical data quality concerns with robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

## Core Capabilities of VTS
Built on top of Apache Seatunnel, Vector-Transport-Service offers:
1. Rich, extensible connectors
2. Unified stream and batch processing for real-time synchronization and offline batch imports
3. Distributed snapshot support for data consistency
4. High performance, low latency, and scalability
5. Real-time monitoring and visual management

Additionally, Vector-Transport-Service introduces vector-specific capabilities such as multiple data source support, schema matching, and basic data validation. 


## Roadmap
Future roadmaps include incremental sync, combined one-time migration and change data capture, and more advanced data transformation capabilities.

## Get Started
To get started with VTS, follow the [QuickStart Guide](#quickstart-guide).

### QuickStart Guide
This guide will help you get started with how to use vts to transport vector data into milvus, currently, we support the following source connectors:
- milvus
- postgres vector
- elastic search
- pinecone
- qdrant
- tencent vectordb

**1. Build the vts project**
```shell
./mvnw install -Dmaven.test.skip
```
**2. Setup the configuration file**

go to ./seatunnel-example/seatunnel-examples/src/main/resources/examples, update the conf file
- milvus_to_milvus.conf
- pg_to_milvus.conf
- es_to_milvus.conf

here is an example of milvus_to_milvus.conf
```yaml
env {
  parallelism = 1
  job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
  Milvus {
    url="https://in01-***.aws-us-west-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19530"
    token="***"
    database="default"
    collection="medium_articles"
    batch_size=100
  }
}

sink {
  Milvus {
    url="https://in01-***.aws-us-west-2.vectordb.zillizcloud.com:19542"
    token="***"
    database="default"
    batch_size=10
  }
}
```
**3. Run examples**

The example file is located at
_./seatunnel-example/seatunnel-examples/src/main/java/com/zilliz/seatunnel/examples/engine/SeatunnelEngineExample.java_

update the configuration file path in _SeatunnelEngineExample.java_, and run the example.
```shell
String configurePath = args.length > 0 ? args[0] : "/examples/****.conf";
```
**4. Check the data in milvus**

go to milvus console, check the data in the collection


### Tutorial
In addition to the quick start guide, vts has much more powerful features like
- lots of transformer to support TabelPathMapper, FieldMapper, Embedding etc.
- cluster mode ready for production use with restful api to manage the job
- docker deploy, etc.

For detailed information, please refer to [Tutorial.md](./Tutorial.md)

### Connectors
VTS supports a variety of connectors to move data between different systems.

Find Detailed documentation for each connector:
 - [Milvus](docs/zilliz/Milvus.md)
 - [Elasitc Search](docs/zilliz/Elastic%20Search.md)
 - [Pinecone](docs/zilliz/Pinecone.md)
 - [Qdrant](docs/zilliz/Qdrant.md)
 - [Postgres Vector](docs/zilliz/Postgres%20Vector.md)
 - [Tencent VectorDB](docs/zilliz/Tencent%20VectorDB.md)
